# MineSweeper

A MineSweeper based on win32api. 

The first click won't be **The Mine**.

The number in one opened block means **how many** mines around it.

Your goal is finding **all of** the mines.

If you click on a **Mine block**, the game will over and you will lose.

Click the **yellow face** to restart

Do not forget to give me star~

基于win32api的扫雷

第一次点击不会是雷。格子里的数字表示它周围有几个雷。游戏目标是找出所有雷。“触雷”则输。点击表情重新开始。
